# try-clojure
A small project to help me learn Clojure/Script

## Development
Install [boot](https://github.com/boot-clj/boot), then in the project dir do:
```
boot dev
```

## Testing
Install [Slimer](https://slimerjs.org/).

Run the tests once with
```
boot test
```
or automatically on code change with
```
boot auto-test
```
